# GoMining ServiceTap

Automatically taps GoMining's daily "maintenance" (service) button for one or
more accounts, so your maintenance-discount streak never lapses, even if
your computer is off. Runs entirely on GitHub Actions (free tier is plenty).

## How it works

- Runs several times a day via GitHub Actions (cloud-hosted, works even if
  your PC is off)
- Authenticates using saved browser session cookies, **never your password**
- Skips gracefully if the button is already on cooldown for the day
- **Self-refreshing**: after every successful run, it saves the account's
  *current* cookies back to the secret. This matters: GoMining appears to
  rotate its refresh token on use, so a cookie captured once and never
  updated will work exactly once and then permanently fail.
- If a saved session ever truly expires, the run fails and GitHub
  automatically emails you

### The reset mechanic

The maintenance discount resets on a **fixed UTC calendar-day boundary
(00:00 UTC)**, not a rolling 24-hour cooldown from your last click, confirmed
via [GoMining's own FAQ](https://help.nft.gomining.com/faq/maintenance-fees-and-discounts).
Missing an entire UTC day resets your whole accumulated streak, not just that
day's increment, which is why this runs multiple times a day rather than
once: GitHub's own scheduler is documented as best-effort and can delay or
occasionally drop an individual run, so more independent attempts per day
meaningfully lowers the odds of a full miss.

## One-time setup

### 1. Fork or clone this repo

Push it to your own GitHub account, private or public, doesn't matter.

### 2. Set your account label

#### <u>Automating one account</u>

Most people only need to automate one account. Edit
`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  GOMINING_ACCOUNT_LABELS: MAIN
  GOMINING_COOKIES_MAIN: ${{ secrets.GOMINING_COOKIES_MAIN }}
```

`MAIN` is just an example. Any short label works, it just has to match
between the two lines.

#### <u>Automating more than one account</u>

Add a comma-separated label for each account, plus a matching
`GOMINING_COOKIES_<LABEL>` line:

```yaml
env:
  GOMINING_ACCOUNT_LABELS: PRIMARY,SECONDARY
  GOMINING_COOKIES_PRIMARY: ${{ secrets.GOMINING_COOKIES_PRIMARY }}
  GOMINING_COOKIES_SECONDARY: ${{ secrets.GOMINING_COOKIES_SECONDARY }}
```

### 3. Capture your account's session cookies

You never enter your GoMining password anywhere in this repo or its
secrets, only session cookies, captured from a real logged-in browser.

**If you're using Claude Code:** this repo ships a `capture-cookies` skill
(`.claude/skills/capture-cookies/SKILL.md`) that walks Claude through doing
this for you interactively. Just ask it to capture cookies for an account.

**Manual method (any browser):**
1. Log into <https://app.gomining.com> normally
2. Open DevTools (F12) → **Application** tab → **Storage → Cookies** →
   `https://app.gomining.com`
3. Note the values for these cookie names: `cf_clearance`, `brwsr`,
   `irtps`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `sa-user-id`, `sa-user-id-v2`,
   `sa-user-id-v3`, `viewport`
4. Build a JSON array from them, one object per cookie, matching this shape:
   ```json
   [{"name": "access_token", "value": "...", "domain": ".gomining.com", "path": "/", "expires": 1234567890, "httpOnly": false, "secure": true, "sameSite": "Lax"}]
   ```
   (`domain`/`httpOnly`/`secure`/`sameSite` are visible as columns in the
   same DevTools cookie table.)

### 4. Add the GitHub Secrets

In your repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository
secret**.

- One `GOMINING_COOKIES_<LABEL>` secret per account, paste the JSON array
  from step 3
- `GH_PAT_SECRETS_WRITE`, a **fine-grained** GitHub personal access token,
  scoped to **only this repo**, with **Secrets: read and write** permission
  and nothing else. This is what lets the script self-refresh the cookie
  secrets above after each run. Create one at
  <https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta>.

### 5. Test it

**Actions** tab → "Daily Service Button Tap" → **Run workflow**. Check the
log: you want to see `OK` for every account, not `FAILED`.

### 6. Let it run

From here it's fully automated on the schedule in
`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`.

**Give it a day or two before worrying.** It's normal (not a sign anything's
misconfigured) for the first scheduled run(s) after setup to be late or not
fire at all. GitHub's scheduler is documented as best-effort (individual runs
can lag 15-45+ minutes, or occasionally skip a slot), and in our own testing
the very first scheduled workflow we ever created took over 24 hours to fire
even once. It reliably got more consistent once the schedule had simply
existed, untouched, for a while. This is exactly why the workflow runs 7
times a night instead of once: one flaky slot doesn't matter when 6 more are
coming. The same adjustment period tends to happen again after *any* edit to
the schedule, not just the first setup. See `CLAUDE.md` if you change it and
runs seem to go quiet for a bit.

### 7. (Optional) Add Sentry error monitoring

The script and workflow work fully without this. It's just better
visibility. Two things Sentry adds that GitHub's own failure emails can't:
searchable error history/trends across runs, and, the more important one,
detecting when the schedule **fails to fire at all**. GitHub only emails you
about a run that started and failed; a run that never started produces
nothing. Sentry's cron monitor alerts if no check-in arrives within the
expected window, closing that gap.

1. Create a free Sentry project (any org) and grab its DSN
2. Add it as a repository secret named `SENTRY_DSN`
3. That's it: `gomining_maintenance.py` picks it up automatically next run

If you skip this, everything still works, you just rely on GitHub's
failure emails alone, which is exactly what this repo ran on for a while.

## Staying up to date

This repo gets occasional fixes. Your fork **does not update itself** — pull
changes when you want them:

- **One-off:** open your fork on GitHub and click **Sync fork** on the main
  page. It shows "This branch is N commits behind" when there's something to
  pull, and merges automatically unless you've edited the same lines an
  update also changes (you edited the `env:` block of
  `.github/workflows/maintenance.yml` during setup, so if an update also
  touches that file, GitHub may ask you to merge it by hand — usually a
  quick, non-overlapping merge).
- **Get notified:** on
  [the upstream repo](https://github.com/jdobbsclt/gomining-servicetap),
  click **Watch → Custom → Releases** so GitHub emails you when a new
  version ships.

Updates only ever change the script and docs (and occasionally the schedule
in `maintenance.yml`) — never your GitHub Secrets.

## If a run fails

Each account gets up to 3 attempts within a single run before it's reported
as failed, so a one-off hiccup (a slow page load, for example) usually
resolves itself without you ever seeing it. GitHub emails you automatically
only once a run has actually exhausted its attempts and failed. Check the
run log first:

- **"redirected to login"**: that account's session expired. This one isn't
  retried (a dead session fails the same way every time), so you'll see it
  right away. Recapture its cookies (step 3 above) and update its secret.
- **Anything else**: a screenshot + HTML snapshot of the page at the moment
  of failure are uploaded as a `debug-artifacts` workflow artifact, to help
  figure out what actually happened.

If a scheduled run doesn't fire *at all* (no email, nothing in the Actions
tab), that's invisible to GitHub's own notifications by design. See step 7
above (Sentry) if you want to catch that case too.

## Maintainer notes (if you're editing this repo, not just using it)

See `CLAUDE.md` for operational gotchas learned the hard way: GitHub's
`schedule` trigger can get "stuck" and needs a disable/re-enable cycle after
editing the cron, its timing is best-effort by design, and there's a
multi-account `gh` CLI quirk worth knowing about.

## A note on storing session cookies

This automation works by saving your GoMining session cookies (not your
password) as encrypted GitHub Secrets. Worth understanding what that
actually means before you set this up:

- **What's protected**: GitHub encrypts secrets at rest and never displays
  them again once set, not through the website, the API, or any tool,
  including to you. They only exist as plain text for the few seconds a
  scheduled run is actually executing, inside GitHub's own cloud runner.
- **This is not your password**: these cookies grant a *live session*, not
  your login credentials. Someone who obtained them could act as your
  logged-in account on GoMining's website for as long as the cookies stay
  valid, similar to someone stealing a "stay signed in" browser session.
  They could not log in fresh, change your password, or get past
  GoMining's own account-recovery process with just these cookies.
- **Who could actually access them**: only whoever has push access to
  *your* fork of this repo, since only they could add a workflow step that
  intentionally reveals a secret's value. In practice, the thing actually
  worth protecting is your own GitHub account (a strong password and 2FA),
  not anything specific to this project.
- **If you ever suspect a leak**: recapture fresh cookies (step 3) and
  overwrite the old secret right away, treat it like a stolen "remember
  me" session.

This is a standard risk for any tool that automates a logged-in web
session on your behalf, it isn't unique to this repo, but you should
understand it before deciding to use this.

## A note on GoMining's terms

We read GoMining's [Terms of Use](https://gomining.com/terms) directly to
check this. The terms do prohibit bots/automation in a few places, but each
one is scoped to a specific feature, not the daily maintenance button:
Bonus Miner rewards (2.6.6), the Miner Wars "Spell Bot" (4.3.6), the AI
Assistant (8.4.7d), and raffle/contest entries (10.3). The maintenance
discount itself (3.1-3.2) has no automation restriction attached to it
anywhere in the document.

Automating your own account's daily maintenance tap also appears to be a
fairly common, openly-discussed practice in the GoMining community (see e.g.
[this browser extension that does the same thing](https://gist.github.com/magicdude4eva/11a9b24e2066a5f0198c6df241d5059f)).

That said, the terms (Section 42) also reserve the right to terminate any
account "for any other reason or no reason," a standard broad clause that
applies regardless of any specific rule being broken. This isn't legal
advice, terms can change, and you should check GoMining's current Terms of
Service yourself before relying on this.
